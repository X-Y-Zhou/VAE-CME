Here we consider $\tau$ follows a Normal distribution $\text{Normal}(\mu,\sigma)$. For training, we input $\text{Attribute}=0$ to reconstruct probability distributions with $\tau\sim\text{Normal}(30,0)$ and input $\text{Attribute}=1$ to reconstruct probability distributions with $\tau\sim\text{Normal}(30,10)$. After training, The proportional relationship between the Attribute and $\sigma$ is

$$
\text{Attribute} = \sigma/10
$$
